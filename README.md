## What's this?

It is software for fragment analysis (MLPA, QF-PCR etc.) data processing.

## Features

FragalyseQt version 0.3+ supports assays with up to 8 different dyes used simultaneously,
selective channel hiding, non-Latin run names, can correctly handle damaged files,
exports peaks locations, areas, FWHM's and channel names in CSV for any *.FSA files and
exports in CSV internal analysis data for *.FSA files generated by ABI 3500 and SeqStudio
series equipment. Peaks areas are calculated assuming they are Gaussian peaks. For noisy runs
denoising and baseline correction is available. All the things are done without rewriting any
data inside files FragalyseQt works with!

## What file formats are supported?

Currently, only *.FSA files are supported. I've tried to add SCF files support, but SCF
supports only 4 fluorescence channels and can't store information about size standard used
for current assay. This renders SCF file format quite obsolete and unusable for modern
assays and thus, this program won't support it.

But, anyway, if you wish to add support for any file format, you may help to implement it
by sending patches.

## What FragalyseQt is useful for?

Currently it is helpful for capillary electrophoresis troubleshooting and not so complex analysis
of sized data obtained using 3500 or SeqStudio family analyzers. If you know precisely your peaks
positions and no sizong is required - you mayuse FragalyseQt for these data analysis too.

## What features are planned for FragalyseQt?

Well, first of all - HID file support (working on it) and sizing (a bit more complex part of work).
In future I plan to add bining support to allow automated genotyping usin FragalyseQt.

## How can I support you?

You may either provide run files from machines I haven't tested FragalyseQt with, provide patches or
support me financially. Either case, contact me by email ( dorif11 AT gmail DOT com ),Telegram
( t.me/nurgle ) or here, at GitHub. Every help is important!

## What's the license of FragalyseQt?

GNU General Public License version 3.

## How to get it working at *ubuntu/Debian/SUSE/macOS?

Install python 3.8+, git and PyQt5/PyQt6/PySide6 (only these Python bindings for Qt are supported)
in any way that is comfortable to you. After this, clone FragalyseQt from Git repository and install
remaining requirements. I propose you to do this using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dorif/fragalyseqt && cd fragalyseqt/ && pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 main.py
```

If you are using something RHEL-based - read next chapters and may the luck be with you.

## How to get it working at RHEL/Oracle 8+?

Prepare enviroment to run FragalyseQt:

```bash
sudo yum install python-qt5 git
```

Download and run FragalyseQt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dorif/fragalyseqt && cd fragalyseqt/ && pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 main.py
```

## How to get it working at RHEL/CentOS/Oracle/Scientific 7?

These systems have no PyQt5 in their repos, nor you can install PyQt5 at these systems freshly
installed. To install PyQt5 you should first update pip and clean pip cache:

```bash
sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip && rm -rf .pip/cache/
```

After that install packages needed for FragalyseQt to work:

```bash
pip3 install pyqt5 && sudo yum install git
```

Download and run FragalyseQt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dorif/fragalyseqt && cd fragalyseqt/ && pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 main.py
```
