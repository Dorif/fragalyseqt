# README

## What's this?

It is software for fragment analysis (MLPA, QF-PCR etc.) data processing.

## Features

FragalyseQt version 0.2+ supports assays with up to 8 different dyes used simultaneously,
selective channel hiding, non-Latin run names and can correctly handle damaged files,
exporting peaks locations, areas, FWHM's and channel names in CSV for any *.FSA files and
export in CSV internal analysis data for *.FSA files generated by ABI 3500 and SeqStudio
series equipment. Peaks areas are calculated assuming they are Gaussian peaks.

## What file formats are supported?

Currently, only *.FSA files are supported. I've tried to add SCF files support, but SCF
supports only 4 fluorescence channels and can't store information about size standard used
for current assay. This renders SCF file format quite obsolete and unusable for modern
assays and thus, this program won't support it.

But, anyway, if you wish to add support for any file firmat, you may help to implement it
by sending patches.

## What's the license of FragalyseQt?
